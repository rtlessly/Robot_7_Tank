# Robot_7_Tank

Robot on "tank" chassis with ultrasonic and IR object avoidance, IR step sensor, and IMU.

 * Uses OSEPP Tri-Tank chassis in "long tank" configuration
 * Uses Adafruit motor controller shield to control motors
 * Ultrasonic sensor (aka sonar) scans for objects ahead in path
 * Sonar is mounted on a servo to allow it to be pivoted left and right to scan for best alternate route when object encountered
 * IR proximity sensors detect objects to the side; robot turns away from obstacle until no longer detected
 * Another IR proximity sensor is used as a forward step sensor
 * IMU used to measure robot orientation and measure turn angles
 * Simple IR sensor to turn motors on/off via IR remote
